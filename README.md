RPC is a protocol that allows a program to call a procedure on a remote machine. Unlike RESTful APIs, which center around resources, RPC-based APIs focus on actions.

gRPC is one of the most popular RPC frameworks. It provide many benefits over tranditional RPC frameworks. gRPC is based on HTTP/2, which is more efficient than HTTP/1.1. gRPC user protobuf as the default data serialization format, which is a binary format that is more compact and effcient than JSON.The tooling support for gRPC is also very good. It follows the contract-first approach, which means we can create language-neutral service definitions and generate code for different languages. It also supports streaminig, which is very userful feature for realtime communication.

With the increasing popularity of microservices, gRPC is becomming more and more popular. While gRPC offers some advantages over RESTFul APIs, it is not considered a complete replacement. gRPC is an excellent choice for high-performance, low-latency communication between microservices, but RESTFul APIs are more suitable for web-based applications and scenarios where simplicity, the requirements of your specific use case.
